        <h3>Freshii</h3>
        <p class="light"> chef</p>
        <p class="justified">worked as a general chef at Freshii(vancouver) for 5 months, during 2020. At Freshii, I worked with a team of 1 or 2 other people. We had to be coordinated and efficient in order to have a fast and good business day, therefore, I had to learn to cooperate fairly fast. I also learned how to take ownership of alot of aspects of the job when I worked there.</p>

        <h3>VMSL referee </h3>
        <p class="light">junior referee</p>
        <p class="justified">worked as a referee for the vancouver soccer club for a total of 2 years. In these 2 years, I learned a lot as a referee. I learned that the players can get very angry and they could react very violently especially if you are a referee for a fairly high level game. It could also get really bad if the teams that are playing against each other are rivals and that they have previous history of being very ansty against each other. Thats why you need to do your homework as a referee.</p>
