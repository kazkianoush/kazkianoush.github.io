    <h1><u>HISTORY</u></h1>
    <p>One hundred and seven years ago, it was said that humans were brought to the brink of extinction at the hands of the Titans "almost overnight." In response to this, the survivors made huge Walls to protect their last stronghold.[16] In reality, however, King Karl Fritz decided to end the Great Titan War and the fighting within the Eldian Empire by withdrawing to Paradis Island, taking as many of his people with him as he could. He then enclosed them within three concentric Walls,[17] which would be named after Ymir Fritz's three daughters; Sheena, Rose, and Maria.[1] After Marley started sending Pure Titans to the island,[18][19] the Eldians inside were taught that they are the last of humanity who built the Walls to escape the Titans.[20]

In an attempt to isolate his people and create a peaceful utopia for them as long as possible, Karl Fritz told the world that any attempt to attack the Walls would result in him unleashing millions of Colossus Titans to flatten the earth.[21][22] Then, to ensure the Founding Titan would never be used for war, he made a vow to renounce it, and his will was passed down to all his descendants.[23]

Fritz realized that this would leave his people defenseless, but decided that if Marley wished to exterminate all Eldians, they should accept it because of how grave the Eldian Empire's crimes against the world had been. But until that day, he wished for his people to have a paradise without conflict.[24]</p>

    <h1><u>FUN FACTS</u></h1>
    <p>The Walls reached about 50 meters in height from bottom to top and were incredibly strong in substance, but not indestructible.[8] The Female Titan was able to damage part of Wall Sheena when she attempted to climb over it,[9] and the Beast Titan was able to break off pieces of Wall Rose and throw them.[10]

The Walls were too long to be guarded in their entirety. The tops of the Walls were lined with cannons mounted on rails which could fire on approaching Titans; however, they were not particularly effective due to the Titan's regeneration abilities.[11] To account for this, each Wall had four towns on their periphery known as "districts." As Titans are drawn towards large concentrations of people, humanity could focus its defenses on these districts and repel the Titans more effectively. The districts were considered the worst places to live as they were at greater risk of Titan invasion.[12]

Few people knew about the Titans within the Walls, or that they were created from said Titans.[13] The Survey Corps learned of their existence when the Female Titan damaged the surface of Wall Sheena, exposing the face of a huge Titan. Minister Nick, the foremost member of a cult which considers the Walls to be holy, knew of the Titans within them but did not reveal any more information - even when threatened with death by Hange ZoÃ«.[14][15] It is unknown how commonplace this knowledge is within the Church of the Walls.</p>
